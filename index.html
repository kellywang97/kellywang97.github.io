		Thoughts on <b>Hard Core</b>
		<p> 
		It was quite interesting to read to about Williams’ ​Hard Core​ since it is one of the first
serious scholarly examinations of pornography. Pornography is one of the tabooed things that people avoid talking about while everyone watches it. I remember seeing some statistics about how Pornhub is one of the most visited websites after Google. Considering the field of economy the industry is taking up and the amount of money it is generating, so I’ve been curious about how this industry is working as the structure and power dynamics behind it. I think of pornography as a necessary evil because it is how people resolve their sexual desires or loneliness. I’m against prostitution because I do think that it’s highly abusive and repressive; and most workers especially women are not protected in their economic, health, and social rights in the exchange. However, pornography can aid people’s masturbating process and thus would help prevent possible sexual violence. </p>

	Williams argues, “For women, one constant of the history of sexuality has been a failure to imagine their pleasures outside a dominant male economy” (4). Even today, sex sells, and women are the objects in the financial exchanges. Even if a porn star argues that she loves her job and that she isn’t just performing sexual activities for the money, I believe she is still acting in the structural power dynamic where she is exploited. I honestly think that no women would have sex for money if it wasn’t for the sum of money and if there were other alternatives for jobs
that were equally profitable. As Foucault has argued, sex has a great relationship to power. One could argue that because women are enjoying sex openly in the pornographic videos, they represent empowerment or sexual liberation of the female. However, pornography is still mostly directed by men, for male consumers, and ultimately consumed by men. It is something to wonder how the industry continues to survive in a sustainable model because sexual act directed in male gaze are quite repetitive and unvarying. As Williams describes, pornography is something that one knows when he or she sees it, or in some essence, something that moves. Sex has appeal because it has been a taboo subject for centuries. I think pornography brings a strange sense of power to people who watch it, as viewers feel like infiltrating the actor’s privacy by watching it. What makes it highly private is that not only the genitals are shown, but also the actions are shown in film format. For many people, sex is private and the intimate moment are shared exclusively with the partner. Pornography is highly addictive because it makes the viewers feel that they are subversive by crossing this boundary of the private sphere and this subversion emboldens and empowers them at the same time.iven that porn is illegal in most countries in the world, this illicit seductivity is only heightened, not reduced. </P>

<b>Williams goes on and talks about fetishism and the hard core.</b><br> 
<i>She states that ultimate goal of this book is to determine how hard core “speaks” of sex.</i><br> She argues that sex is ironically entirely social while being biological and natural. Pornography has social importance. First hard core films were incorporated into feature-length exploitation films in the early 1970s. ​Deep Throat​ opened in 1972 at a somewhat legitimate theater setting. This film is highly focused on male orgasm which has been the focus of sexual act for centuries. I think this movie exemplifies that female orgasm is false and that people are only interested in seeing women used to please men.

<hr>
<a href="https://google.com" target="blank"> This movie attempts to deceive</a> the audience by the placement of clitoris in the female protagonist’s throat; I found this to be ridiculous not only because it is biologically impossible but also it is just an excuse to show women suffer while she performs oral sex on men. This film misleads the audience that women feel sexual pleasure by pleasuring their men. It is quite pathetic that films like this are continuously produced in modern pornography, creating a construct in which women are meant and compelled to derive pleasure from giving pleasure to men. These early hard core films also demonstrate that people and media focus too much in “phallic power” and dehumanization of women. </p>
